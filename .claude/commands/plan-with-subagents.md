# Plan with Subagents

Create structured implementation plans that assign appropriate tasks to each step and include PR validation.

Planning request: $ARGUMENTS

## Before Planning: Rules Index

**IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.**

Read `CLAUDE.md` and project documentation for the compressed Rules Index. When planning tasks that touch specific areas, note which rules apply:

| File Pattern | Rule to Include in Plan |
|--------------|------------------------|
| `app/repositories/*.ts` | Repository pattern (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `app/trpc/routes/*.ts` | Repository pattern (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `app/routes/**/*.tsx` | Routes conventions (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `app/db/schema.ts` | Database conventions (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `app/components/*-modal.tsx` | Modal patterns (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `**/stripe*`, `**/payment*` | Stripe conventions (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `e2e/**/*` | Playwright rules (see CLAUDE.md) |
| `docs/**/*.md` | Documentation conventions (see CLAUDE.md) |

Include rule requirements in task descriptions so each step knows what patterns to follow.

## When to Use

- User requests a plan for feature implementation
- Complex tasks requiring multiple files/layers
- Work that will result in a PR

## Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Work Request

Identify:
1. **Type of work**: Feature, bug fix, or refactor
2. **Scope**: Files and layers affected
3. **Dependencies**: Order constraints between tasks

### Step 2: Break Down into Tasks

Create tasks following the data flow pattern:

```
1. Competitive Research (if new feature with UX decisions)
2. Schema/Database changes
3. Repository layer
4. tRPC routes
5. UI Components
6. Route pages
7. Feature Architecture Documentation (docs/features/)
8. Debug Logging (for complex logic/integrations)
9. Testing
10. Context Documentation
11. Architecture Documentation (high-level-architecture.md)
12. Analytics Dashboard (if new data to track)
13. Principal Review (plan alignment + implementation quality)
14. PR Validation
```

Skip layers not affected by the work.

### Step 3: Assign Task Types

Map each task to the appropriate approach:

| Task Type | Approach | When to Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Database exploration | Read and search codebase | Understanding schema, finding related code |
| Schema changes | Direct implementation | Adding tables, fields, migrations |
| Repository/tRPC | Direct implementation | Business logic implementation |
| UI Components | Direct implementation | Building React components |
| Styling from Figma | CSS variable conversion | Converting Figma designs |
| Design validation | Bash with playwright | Verifying UI matches designs |
| Add logging | Direct implementation | Adding debug logs to code |
| Testing | Bash with playwright + write tests | Verify implementation, write e2e tests |
| Documentation | Direct file editing | Update project docs |
| Architecture Docs | /architecture-tracker | Update route maps, flows, changelog |
| Analytics | Direct implementation | Create dashboards for new data |
| Principal Review | /principal-review | Plan alignment + implementation quality |
| PR Validation | /pr-checker | Final validation step |

### Step 4: Build the Plan

Output format:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

### Overview
{Brief description of what will be implemented}

### Tasks

## File Pattern → Validation Mapping

When a task touches certain files, note the validation requirement:

| File Pattern | Required Check |
|--------------|----------------|
| `app/repositories/*.ts` | Repository pattern compliance |
| `app/trpc/routes/*.ts` | tRPC validation, Zod inputs |
| `app/routes/**/*.tsx` | Route conventions, auth checks |
| `app/db/schema.ts` | Migration with descriptive name |
| `drizzle/*.sql` | Migration naming convention |
| `app/models/*.ts` | Zod schema standards |
| `app/components/*-modal.tsx` | Modal pattern compliance |
| `e2e/**/*` | Playwright rules |

## Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL: SCREENSHOTS ARE MANDATORY**

**TESTING IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT SCREENSHOTS.**

Every implementation plan MUST include testing that follows this workflow:

1. **Browser Verification** - Use Bash with playwright to verify the feature works
2. **Capture Evidence** - Take screenshots to `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/` **<-- MANDATORY**
3. **Copy to Public** - Copy screenshots to `public/docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/` **<-- MANDATORY**
4. **Write E2E Tests** - Convert browser actions to `e2e/{feature}.spec.ts`
5. **Document Tests** - Create `docs/testing/{feature}/{feature}.md` with:
   - YAML frontmatter: `title`, `date: YYYY-MM-DD` (use **current date** so the doc sorts correctly in `/admin/docs`)
   - Test scenarios and descriptions
   - **Screenshots embedded with markdown image links** **<-- MANDATORY**
   - Test IDs reference table
   - E2E test coverage list

**Testing task is NOT complete until screenshots are:**
- [ ] Taken with Bash using playwright
- [ ] Saved to `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`
- [ ] Copied to `public/docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`
- [ ] Embedded in test documentation markdown file

### Testing Task Example

```markdown
#### Task: Test Implementation
**Approach:** Bash with playwright + write e2e tests
**Description:**
1. Create testing plan at `docs/testing/{feature}/{feature}.md`
2. Verify feature with Bash using playwright
3. **MANDATORY: Save screenshots to `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`**
4. **MANDATORY: Copy screenshots to `public/docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`**
5. **MANDATORY: Embed screenshots in test documentation**
6. Write e2e tests in `e2e/{feature}.spec.ts`
7. Add data-testid attributes to key elements

**CRITICAL OUTPUTS (all required):**
- Testing plan: `docs/testing/{feature}/{feature}.md` with embedded screenshots
- Screenshots: `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/*.png` (at least 3-5 screenshots)
- Public copy: `public/docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/*.png`
- E2E test file: `e2e/{feature}.spec.ts`
- Data-testid attributes on all interactive elements

**This task is NOT complete without screenshots in both locations and embedded in documentation.**
```

## Final Step: PR Validation Checklist

Always include this at the end of every plan:

```markdown
### Principal Review (before PR validation)

Run /principal-review to verify:
- [ ] Implementation matches the plan (scope, acceptance criteria, data model, APIs)
- [ ] Implementation quality: architecture, patterns, security, maintainability

Then run PR validation below.

### PR Validation (before creating PR)

Run /pr-checker which validates:

- [ ] Code rules compliance (per file patterns above)
- [ ] **Implementation plan saved** (`docs/plans/{feature}-implementation.md`)
- [ ] **Research doc exists** (`docs/research/{feature}-research.md`) - if new user-facing feature
- [ ] **Feature architecture doc exists** (`docs/features/{feature}-architecture.md`)
- [ ] Project docs updated (if feature/architecture change)
- [ ] Testing plan exists (`docs/testing/{feature}/`)
- [ ] **E2E tests written in `e2e/`**
- [ ] Migrations use /db-migration (if applicable)
- [ ] **Debug logging added** (if complex logic/integrations)
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard created** (if new trackable data)
```
