# UX Product Thinking

A structured approach to UI/UX design that aligns interface decisions with product goals. Uses WebSearch for competitive research, market research reports for ICP analysis, image generation for UI concepts, and produces mermaid diagrams for visualization.

Feature or design request: $ARGUMENTS

## Project Context

**mise en place** — A recipe management app for home cooks who save recipes from YouTube cooking videos and food blogs. Instead of manually copying ingredients and steps, users paste a URL and AI extracts everything automatically—including video timestamps for easy reference. The app also features weekly meal planning with aggregated grocery lists.

**Target Audience**: Home cooks who frequently discover recipes online and want a single place to organize, plan, and shop for their meals.

**Design Direction**: Editorial cookbook aesthetic—warm, artisanal design inspired by classic cookbooks. Playfair Display for headings, Source Sans 3 for body text. Terracotta and sage color palette with grain textures and warm shadows.

## Rules Reference

**IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.**

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the compressed Rules Index. When implementing designs, ensure compliance with:
- Tailwind CSS variables and semantic colors (no hardcoded hex values)
- Modal component patterns
- Route and page structure

## When to Use

- Researching competitors and design inspiration
- Gathering branding colors and guidelines
- Designing a new feature or screen
- Mapping user journeys and flows
- Breaking down UI into components
- Evaluating UX trade-offs
- Documenting interface architecture
- **Analyzing market research reports with ICP data**
- **Generating UI concepts for different user personas**

## Core Framework: RESEARCH → GOALS → USERS → FLOWS → DESIGN → UI → CONCEPTS

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R[Research] --> G[Product Goals]
    G --> U[User Needs/ICPs]
    U --> F[User Flows]
    F --> C[Components]
    C --> D[Design Spec]
    D --> UI[UI Concepts]
    UI --> I[Implementation]
```

Work through each layer before moving to the next. The **UI Concepts** phase generates visual mockups for each ICP before implementation.

## Input Sources

This skill supports two research input paths:

### Path A: Live Research (WebSearch + WebFetch)
Use when you need to gather fresh competitive intelligence. See **Phase 0** below.

### Path B: Market Research Reports
Use when you have existing research documents (from tools, consultants, or prior analysis).

**When to use Path B:**
- User provides a market research report file
- Research already contains ICP analysis with fit scores
- Competitive analysis is already documented
- You want to skip to ICP-targeted design

**Market Research Report Extraction:**
```markdown
When given a research report, extract:

1. **ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles)**
   - Demographics and attributes
   - Pain points and frustrations
   - Goals and motivations
   - Fit scores if provided
   - Preferred channels

2. **Competitive Positioning**
   - Key competitors
   - Feature comparison
   - Differentiation opportunities
   - Market gaps

3. **Recommended Features**
   - Priority ranking
   - Demand level
   - Coverage status (none/partial/saturated)
```

---

## Phase 0: Competitive Research (WebSearch + WebFetch)

Before defining goals, research the landscape. Use **WebSearch** and **WebFetch** tools to gather competitive intelligence and design inspiration.

### Research Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Define research scope]) --> Search[WebSearch: Find competitors]
    Search --> Extract[WebFetch: Pull landing pages]
    Extract --> Analyze[Analyze patterns]
    Analyze --> Document[Document findings]
```

### 1. Find Competitors and Similar Products

Use `WebSearch` to discover competitors:

```
WebSearch: "[your product type] SaaS alternatives 2026"
```

**Search queries to try:**
- `"[product category] best tools comparison"`
- `"[product category] landing page examples"`
- `"[competitor name] design system"`
- `"[industry] SaaS UI trends 2026"`

### 2. Extract Branding & Design from Competitor Sites

Use `WebFetch` to pull content from competitor pages:

```
WebFetch:
  url: "https://competitor.com"
  prompt: "Extract branding colors, design style, typography, layout patterns"
```

**Pages to extract:**
- Landing/home page (hero messaging, CTA style)
- Pricing page (tier structure, feature presentation)
- About page (brand voice, values)
- Product screenshots (UI patterns)

### 3. Explore Site Structure

Use `WebFetch` to understand information architecture:

```
WebFetch:
  url: "https://competitor.com"
  prompt: "Find navigation structure, key features, and design patterns"
```

### Research Documentation Template

```markdown
## Competitive Research: [Feature/Product]

### Competitors Analyzed
| Competitor | URL | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----|-----------|------------|
| [Name] | [URL] | [What they do well] | [Gaps/opportunities] |

### Branding Patterns Observed
**Color Palettes:**
- Competitor A: Primary #XXXXX, Accent #XXXXX
- Competitor B: Primary #XXXXX, Accent #XXXXX
- **Common trend**: [e.g., "Dark mode with vibrant accents"]

**Typography:**
- Headlines: [Common font styles]
- Body: [Common font choices]

**Visual Style:**
- [e.g., "Minimalist with bold CTAs"]
- [e.g., "Illustration-heavy, friendly tone"]

### UX Patterns Worth Adopting
1. [Pattern]: [Where seen] - [Why it works]
2. [Pattern]: [Where seen] - [Why it works]

### Differentiation Opportunities
- [Gap in market we can fill]
- [Unique angle competitors miss]

### Design Inspiration
| Element | Source | Screenshot/URL | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Hero layout | [Competitor] | [URL] | [What to borrow] |
| Pricing cards | [Competitor] | [URL] | [What to borrow] |
```

### Competitive Landscape Diagram

    Competitor A: [0.7, 0.8]
    Competitor B: [0.3, 0.4]
    Our Product: [0.5, 0.6]
```

---

## Phase 1: Product Goals Analysis

Before any UI work, clarify what success looks like.

### Goal Mapping Template

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

### Business Goals
- Primary: [e.g., Increase conversion by 15%]
- Secondary: [e.g., Reduce support tickets]

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | How Measured |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| [Metric] | [Value] | [Value] | [Method] |

### Constraints
- Technical: [e.g., Must work offline]
- Business: [e.g., Ship by Q2]
- Design: [e.g., Match existing design system]
```

### Goal Priority Diagram

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Feature Priority Matrix

    y-axis Low Business Value --> High Business Value
    quadrant-1 Do First
    quadrant-2 Plan Next
    quadrant-3 Deprioritize
    quadrant-4 Quick Wins
```

---

## Phase 2: User Analysis

Understand who uses the feature and what they need.

### ICP Analysis (from Market Research)

When working with market research reports that contain ICP data, structure the analysis:

```markdown
### ICP Overview

| ICP | Fit Score | Primary Pain | Key Feature Need |
|-----|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| [Name] | XX/100 | [Pain point] | [Feature] |

### ICP 1: [Name]
**Fit Score**: XX/100 | [Primary/Secondary/Tertiary Target]

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Demographics** | [Age, role, context] |
| **Discovery** | [How they find products] |
| **Primary Pain** | [Main frustration] |
| **Secondary Pain** | [Additional frustrations] |
| **Key Feature Need** | [What they need most] |
| **Willingness to Pay** | [Low/Medium/High + context] |

**Messaging Focus**: "[One-line positioning]"

**Hero Copy Options**:
- "[Option 1]"
- "[Option 2]"
- "[Option 3]"
```

### ICP Positioning Diagram

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title ICP Fit vs Market Size
    x-axis Small Market --> Large Market
    y-axis Low Fit --> High Fit
    quadrant-1 Primary Target
    quadrant-2 Growth Opportunity
    quadrant-3 Deprioritize
    quadrant-4 Quick Wins
    "ICP 1": [0.35, 0.72]
    "ICP 2": [0.75, 0.68]
    "ICP 3": [0.40, 0.58]
```

### User Persona Quick Template

```markdown
## Persona: [Name]

**Role**: [Job title or user type]
**Goal**: [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Pain Points**:
- [Current frustration 1]
- [Current frustration 2]

**Context**: [When/where they use the product]
**Tech Comfort**: [Low/Medium/High]
```

### User Mental Model Diagram

```mermaid

    User Expectation 1
      Sub-expectation
      Sub-expectation
    User Expectation 2
      Sub-expectation
    User Expectation 3
```

---

## Phase 3: User Flow Design

Map how users move through the feature.

### Flow Types

1. **Happy Path**: Ideal journey to goal completion
2. **Error Paths**: Recovery from mistakes
3. **Edge Cases**: Unusual but valid scenarios

### User Flow Diagram Template

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User arrives]) --> A{Has account?}
    A -->|Yes| B[Show dashboard]
    A -->|No| C[Show signup CTA]
    B --> D[User takes action]
    D --> E{Action successful?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Show success state]
    E -->|No| G[Show error + recovery]
    G --> D
    F --> End([Goal completed])
```

### Journey Map Template

```mermaid
journey
    title User Journey: [Feature Name]
    section Discovery
      Find feature: 3: User
      Understand purpose: 4: User
    section Engagement
      Start task: 5: User
      Complete steps: 4: User
    section Completion
      See results: 5: User
      Share/export: 3: User
```

### State Machine for Complex UI

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Loading: user action
    Loading --> Success: data received
    Loading --> Error: request failed
    Success --> Idle: reset
    Error --> Loading: retry
    Error --> Idle: dismiss
```

---

## Phase 4: Component Architecture

Break the UI into logical, reusable parts.

### DRY Pre-Check: Existing Shared Components

**Before designing new components**, run /dry-audit and check what already exists:

| What | Where to Look |
|------|---------------|
| Loading spinners | `app/components/ui/` — reuse before creating new ones |
| Error/failed states | `app/components/` or `app/routes/platform/components/shared/` |
| Empty states | `app/routes/platform/components/shared/` |
| Status badges | `app/routes/platform/components/shared/` |
| Source citations | `app/routes/platform/components/market-research/common/` |
| Base Zod schemas | `app/models/<domain>/common.ts` — extend, don't duplicate |

Design new components only when existing shared components don't cover the need. When a pattern appears in 2+ features, extract it to `shared/`.

### Component Hierarchy Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Page["Page: FeaturePage"]
        subgraph Layout["Layout Components"]
            Header[Header]
            Sidebar[Sidebar]
            Main[Main Content]
        end
        subgraph Feature["Feature Components"]
            FC1[FeatureCard]
            FC2[FeatureList]
            FC3[FeatureDetail]
        end
        subgraph Shared["Shared UI"]
            Button[Button]
            Input[Input]
            Modal[Modal]
        end
    end
```

### Component Spec Template

```markdown
## Component: [Name]

**Purpose**: [Single responsibility]
**Props**:
| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| | | | |

**States**: [idle, loading, error, success]
**Events**: [onClick, onChange, onSubmit]
**Accessibility**: [keyboard nav, aria labels, focus management]
```

### Data Flow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Client
        UI[UI Component] --> Hook[React Hook]
        Hook --> State[Local State]
    end
    subgraph Server
        Hook --> tRPC[tRPC Route]
        tRPC --> Repo[Repository]
        Repo --> DB[(Database)]
    end
```

---

## Phase 5: Wireframe Specification

Text-based wireframe for AI implementation.

### Wireframe Template

```markdown
## Screen: [Name]

### Layout
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header: Logo | Nav | User Menu      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Sidebar    │ Main Content           │
│ - Nav 1    │ ┌─────────────────┐    │
│ - Nav 2    │ │ Card Component  │    │
│ - Nav 3    │ │ - Title         │    │
│            │ │ - Description   │    │
│            │ │ - Action Button │    │
│            │ └─────────────────┘    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Footer: Links | Copyright           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

### Responsive Behavior
- Mobile: Sidebar becomes bottom nav
- Tablet: Sidebar collapses to icons
- Desktop: Full sidebar visible

### Interactions
1. [Element]: [Interaction] → [Result]
2. [Element]: [Interaction] → [Result]
```

---

## Phase 6: Frontend Design Specification

Define the **distinctive visual identity** before implementation. This phase transforms wireframes into a memorable, production-ready design direction.

**Read and apply the /frontend-design command** for detailed guidelines on:
- Design thinking (purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation)
- Typography (distinctive fonts, never Inter/Roboto/Arial)
- Color & theme (dominant + sharp accent)
- Motion (high-impact moments over scattered micro-interactions)
- Spatial composition (asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking)
- Visual details (textures, gradients, depth)

### Design Spec Output Template

Document in the architecture doc:

```markdown
## Frontend Design Specification

### Aesthetic Direction
**Tone**: [e.g., brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, editorial]
**Memorable Element**: [The ONE thing users will remember]

### Typography
| Usage | Font | Weight |
|-------|------|--------|
| Display | [Distinctive font] | [Weight] |
| Body | [Refined font] | [Weight] |

### Color Palette
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| --primary | #XXXXXX | [Usage] |
| --accent | #XXXXXX | [Usage] |
| --background | #XXXXXX | [Usage] |

### Motion Design
- **Page load**: [Animation approach]
- **Key interaction**: [Signature moment]

### Visual Effects
[Background treatment, textures, shadows]
```

---

## Phase 7: UI Concept Generation

Generate visual mockups for each ICP using image generation tools. This creates tangible design references before implementation.

### When to Generate UI Concepts

- Landing pages targeting multiple ICPs
- Marketing pages with persona-specific messaging
- Feature pages that need ICP-specific framing
- A/B test variations for different audiences

### UI Concept Generation Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ICPs[Identify ICPs from research] --> Design[Define design direction per ICP]
    Design --> Prompts[Craft detailed image prompts]
    Prompts --> Generate[Generate images]
    Generate --> Save[Save to public/docs/]
    Save --> Embed[Embed in architecture document]
```

### Image Prompt Template

For each ICP, create a detailed prompt:

```
Landing page UI concept for [product] targeting [ICP name and description].
[Design aesthetic] aesthetic with [tone description].

Layout: [Layout type], [viewport] view ([dimensions])
- [Hero section description]
- [Key visual elements]

Color palette:
- [Background color with hex]
- [Primary color with hex] for [usage]
- [Accent color with hex] for [usage]
- [Text color with hex] for [usage]

Typography:
- [Headline style]: "[Headline text]"
- [Subheadline style]: "[Subheadline text]"
- [CTA text and style]

Visual elements:
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]

Style: [Overall style description]. [Tone]. [What to avoid].
```

### Example: ICP-Specific Prompts

**ICP 1: Video-First User**
```
Focus on: Dynamic, playful energy
Hero visual: Video player with timestamp markers
Key elements: Platform logos (YouTube, TikTok), floating timestamp pills
Color emphasis: Heavier primary color for energy
Messaging: Action-oriented ("Stop pausing. Start cooking.")
```

**ICP 2: Overwhelmed Planner**
```
Focus on: Calm, organized, reassuring
Hero visual: Calendar/planner grid with recipe cards
Key elements: Grocery list, time-saved statistics
Color emphasis: More accent color for calm
Messaging: Relief-oriented ("Finally answered.")
```

**ICP 3: Legacy Preserver**
```
Focus on: Nostalgic, warm, heritage
Hero visual: Handwritten → digital transformation
Key elements: Family sharing visualization, preservation badges
Color emphasis: Deeper, warmer tones, gold accents
Messaging: Emotional ("Safe forever.")
```

### Saving and Embedding Concepts

1. **Generate images** using appropriate tools
2. **Copy to public folder**: `public/docs/[feature-name]/`
3. **Embed in architecture doc** using relative paths:

```markdown
### Concept 1: "[Concept Name]" ([ICP Name])

![Concept 1 Description](/docs/[feature]/concept-1.png)

**Visual Direction**: [Description]
**Hero Design**: [Key elements]
**Color Emphasis**: [What stands out]
**Headline**: "[Copy]"
**Subheadline**: "[Copy]"
```

### UI Concepts Section Template

Add to architecture document:

```markdown
## UI Concepts

Three distinct concepts, each tailored to resonate with a specific ICP
while maintaining the [design system] aesthetic.

### Concept 1: "[Theme Name]" ([ICP Name])

![Concept 1](/docs/[feature]/concept-1.png)

**Visual Direction**: [Tone and feel]
**Target Fit Score**: XX/100
**Hero Design**:
- [Layout description]
- [Key visual element]
- [Interactive element]

**Color Emphasis**: [Which colors dominate and why]

**Key Visual Elements**:
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]

**Headline**: "[Copy]"
**Subheadline**: "[Copy]"

---

[Repeat for each ICP]
```
