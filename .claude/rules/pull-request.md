# Pull Request Description Guidelines

When creating a pull request description, **always follow the template** at `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Template Structure

Fill out each section:

1. **Pull Request Type** - Choose one: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `revert`, `rfc`

2. **Purpose** - Clear, concise explanation of what this PR does and why

3. **Linear Tickets** - Link relevant Linear tickets (format: `- LAN-XXX`)

4. **Breaking Changes** - List any breaking changes, or state "None" if there aren't any

5. **Test Cases** - Provide checkbox items for reviewers to verify functionality

6. **Notes** - Any additional context, implementation details, or concerns

7. **Attachments** - Screenshots or screen recordings showing the changes (especially for UI changes)

8. **Self Checklist** - Verify all items before submitting:
   - Tests added/updated and passing
   - Documentation updated
   - `bun run build` succeeds
   - Feature flag created if needed
   - Code reviewed against conventions
   - Database migration does NOT delete data

## Best Practices
- Keep the Purpose focused and scannable
- Write Test Cases that are actionable and specific
- Always include screenshots for UI changes
- Be explicit about Breaking Changes - don't leave it blank
- Reference the actual code changes when describing implementation details
